The here computed posteriors are with a chosen psi by hand, as if to fit the observed data best. 

This means that they should not be used for prediction, since psi is chosen a posterior. This is to see if
the CF model can in principle create the lalinference data set 

the best psi are

v 		1	0.86	0.5
psi_init	0.2	0.79	0.075
